                <DeatilInfo>
                  Royale is a first-of-its-kind decentralized protocol for
                  directing optimized stablecoin liquidity pools toward Web 3.0
                  "smart-backed" funding solutions for products. Royale's
                  mission is to use DeFi protocol innovations to kickstart
                  blockchain gaming businesses. We aim to create an optimized
                  decentralized liquidity network that pushes the limits of
                  innovation and lowers the barriers of entry for the gaming
                  industry.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  We aim to achieve our goals by injecting the unprecedented
                  trust and financial innovation of decentralized finance (DeFi)
                  into the gaming industry. Using the Royale platform, gaming
                  startups can facilitate their development by leveraging our
                  liquidity provision mechanisms and our IGO launchpad
                  initiative.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The hybridization of cryptocurrency and gaming creates unique
                  game applications with a wide array of utilities. The popular
                  Play-to-Earn (P2E) concept was borne out of this marriage, and
                  it reveals what is possible when gaming and crypto are
                  combined innovatively.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  We strongly believe that we have only scratched the surface,
                  and with time, more exciting blockchain gaming applications
                  will enter the market. Royale Finance aims to become the go-to
                  liquidity provider and launchpad for these ambitious gaming
                  projects that want to revolutionize the industry.

                <DeatilInfo>
                  All animals play games. Humans, specifically, have dedicated a
                  large portion of their cognitive power to this culturally
                  universal pursuit. Games are fundamental building blocks of
                  society. Archaeologists have even found six-sided dice amongst
                  the rubble of ancient Paleolithic remains. For a long time,
                  playing games has been a part of human-to-human interaction.
                  Thanks to technology, today's games have advanced, bringing
                  high detailed fantasy worlds to life with weighty and
                  immersive experiences. The thirst for adventure lies at the
                  heart of human culture, and in our modern society, games serve
                  as a safe outlet for this expression.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  It is, therefore, no surprise that the global gaming industry
                  continues to grow at an alarming rate. The gaming market
                  currently sits at USD 173.70 billion, and experts predict it
                  will reach USD 314.40 billion by 2026, registering a growth
                  rate of (CAGR) of 9.64%. This expansion indicates a high
                  demand for games and, most importantly, underscores the
                  potential for true innovation.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  But has there been true gaming innovation?

                  Technology has allowed games to improve graphics, core
                  mechanics, and other visual output, but the main idea behind
                  gaming hasn't changed. It has remained a pastime, something we
                  do when we are bored or less busy. However, with the onset of
                  blockchain technology and its derivatives, this concept of
                  gaming has been turned on its head.

                <SubTitle>The Rise of IGOs</SubTitle>
                <DeatilInfo>
                  Today, several new games now have an additional layer to their
                  purpose. People no longer just play games for fun; instead,
                  games are becoming a source of income for many players all
                  over the world. Blockchain technology has brought ownership to
                  gaming. Play-to-earn (P2E) mechanics allow players to monetize
                  the time spent playing a game or collecting in-game items.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  This changes everything!
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The blockchain gaming sector grew an outstanding 121%,
                  surpassing DeFi and NFTs in 2021. As play-to-earn games gained
                  attention, the crypto world has begun to witness the rise of
                  initial game offerings(IGOs). These IGOs are investment models
                  that allow investors to get in early on blockchain gaming
                  projects with the promise of profitable returns contingent on
                  the success of the blockchain game.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Launching an IGO is not an easy task. Game developers have to
                  factor in marketing strategies, audience targeting, and a host
                  of other expenses. This is where IGO launchpads come into
                  play. They serve as a platform that helps blockchain games
                  launch their IGOs successfully.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  However, the problem is that IGO launchpads do not adhere to
                  the tenets of decentralization. They mainly utilize
                  centralized tier systems that short-change the average
                  investor and allow whales to dominate the process. This can be
                  discouraging and dissuades investors from participating in
                  future IGOs.

                  (AR) and virtual reality (VR) can drastically change the way
                  people play games, nothing really has the potential to alter
                  the gaming experience like blockchain integration and the
                  Play-to-Earn (P2E) concept.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Blockchain technology has provided some amazing tools for a
                  new generation of game developers and entrepreneurs to
                  experiment with. We already see tremendous success with simple
                  P2E browser games; Axie Infinity, for instance, has achieved
                  more than $33 million daily transactions with a lifetime
                  transaction of over $2 billion. When AAA titles adopt this P2E
                  concept, blockchain-powered games could go mainstream.

                  All these issues stem from a parent problem, centralized
                  finance. To effectively tackle these issues, one must not only
                  look at the symptoms but focus on getting rid of the disease
                  itself. Blockchain games attempted to do this via IGOs - a
                  decentralized model that allows investors of all shapes and
                  sizes to participate in launching these gaming platforms.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  However, most IGO launchpads have strayed from the ideal.
                  Constrictive tier-based systems limit the average investor
                  while promoting whale participation. With this profit-centric
                  focus, IGO launchpads have taken their eyes off the ball,
                  becoming the very thing they were originally meant to combat.

                  Royale Finance is entering this space as a platform that seeks
                  to follow the core ideology of decentralization by creating an
                  IGO launchpad system that fully adheres to transparency and
                  fairness. The Royale IGO launchpad will facilitate the
                  development of innovative game platforms in an open and
                  decentralized manner, giving a fair chance to all willing
                  investors.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Centralized finance has a tight hold on liquidity. Banks are
                  often not willing to invest in gaming companies, which leaves
                  them at the mercy of gaming incumbents. In the end, promising
                  projects are unable to get off the ground. Without access to
                  funding, they remain stagnant or die off. Royale Finance will
                  tackle this by adopting a decentralized approach to liquidity
                  provision.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The Royale liquidity provision drive is a community-backed
                  initiative that incentivizes participation through various
                  reward mechanisms. Under this approach, interested game
                  developers submit their projects for consideration, and if
                  selected, the Royale Finance community contributes liquidity
                  to bankroll these projects.

                  As the world begins to embrace the decentralized and
                  open-source Web 3.0 of the future, entrepreneurs are beginning
                  to understand the importance of community in building their
                  vision. One overreaching and vital element of Bitcoin and
                  blockchain's success is the community of early adopters who
                  rallied around its cause. The value of Bitcoin, or pretty much
                  any other cryptocurrency for that matter, is not derived from
                  the cold, hard technology it is based on. Rather, it is the
                  combined efforts of the whole community of ecosystem
                  participants - entrepreneurs, liquidity contributors, and
                  community members alike - that define the future potential for
                  that technology.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In contrast, the old Web 2.0 networks that have driven Nasdaq
                  to such dizzying heights are so profitable because they
                  leverage network effects for the sole benefit of the
                  corporation and its shareholders. These companies then grow at
                  exponential rates for extended periods of time. The community
                  that brings the lion's share of the value to the network is
                  left out in the cold.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In the grand growing tradition of DeFi entities, Royale
                  intends to bestow upon its community a meaningful portion of
                  the network that they actively create, maintain, and grow.
                  After all, those users are people, not just data, and those
                  people comprise the Kings and Queens of Royale. The ROYA token
                  itself serves as a rallying point to coordinate the
                  community's collective action towards our common goal of
                  transforming the gaming industry for the better.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Royale features are built for the community. Our monolithic
                  stablecoin liquidity pool maximizes the opportunity for
                  up-and-coming gaming concepts to gain traction, lowering the
                  barriers to entry in this fast-moving industry. Blockchain
                  technology and on-chain transaction verification of Royale
                  gaming investments emphasize transparency, allowing the
                  community to see for themselves the actions we take with our
                  liquidity pool.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Our long-term goal is for the three Royale ecosystem
                  participants - stablecoin liquidity providers, ROYA stakers,
                  and game developers and entrepreneurs - to become one
                  interwoven, impenetrable force. The entrepreneurs become a
                  part of the community, and the community becomes
                  entrepreneurs. The liquidity providers become gamers and, vice
                  versa, gamers become liquidity providers. Our robust
                  community-first tokenomic model should incentivize behavior
                  that encourages the development of products of value and
                  experiences that matter.

                <DeatilInfo>
                  At its core, Royale will be a two-sided network platform
                  composed of liquidity suppliers and liquidity users. The ROYA
                  token and its community represent a third side that
                  coordinates and weaves itself throughout the platform. While
                  there will be many advantages for game developers and
                  entrepreneurs to access liquidity from and participate in the
                  Royale ecosystem, there will also be crypto-economic
                  incentives to encourage liquidity providers to become
                  long-term ROYA token holders.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  All network participants would benefit from gaming rewards, as
                  portions of these value streams will be distributed throughout
                  the Royale ecosystem according to the governance mechanisms
                  established by ROYA token holders. As the ecosystem builds
                  momentum, it should attract more liquidity, more
                  entrepreneurs, and more ROYA token holders.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  ROYA token holders will therefore have the opportunity to
                  participate in a network that captures significant value from
                  non-crypto sources. Royale aims to expand the application of
                  crypto-economics by targeting a growing niche of the fintech
                  industry that has so far escaped the influence of
                  crypto-economic systems.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The gaming industry is no stranger to cryptocurrencies as a
                  means of payment, but the exponential effects wrought by
                  well-engineered token-based value capture mechanisms have yet
                  to have their impact felt in this growing industry. Users of
                  the Royale platform would not necessarily be gamers; they
                  would be liquidity providers for gaming platforms. They may
                  not necessarily be players, but they would be players who want
                  to be investors.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The team has the experience in the domain to collectively
                  deliver the initiative. The founders, early period management
                  team (before the transition to a DAO structure), and lead
                  developers have all worked and built products and services
                  within the crypto, trading, international business, e-sports,
                  and gaming industries. They now seek to combine their skillset
                  to build a scalable, robust blockchain-based crypto-economic
                  network that can service the gaming industry through a
                  decentralized liquidity provision mechanism and IGO launchpad.

                  The Royale vision drives our product design, which we hope
                  will drive user adoption through verifiably genuine products
                  that have simplified UX/UI that is especially appropriate for
                  the cross-section of players that we believe are attracted to
                  both gaming and DeFi. The Royale ecosystem will aim to support
                  products that are automated, validated, verified, and cater to
                  both new and experienced users.

                  Royale seeks first clients seeking to access their unique
                  blend of blockchain-based services. This business development
                  success has uniquely positioned Royale to support other
                  emerging projects building innovative games that require
                  bankroll facilities. We estimate that the potential market to
                  be quite large.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  With the current exponential growth rate of gaming and DeFi
                  products, we believe that simplifying access to the "House's
                  Edge" could transform the equation for entrepreneurs looking
                  to enter the global gaming industry precisely at a time when
                  this industry stands at an inflection point. The pandemic has
                  pushed people to spend more time on the internet than ever
                  before. And the world is awash with excess value to not only
                  invest but also to play with.

                  Royale's critical success factors will be monitored by a
                  multitude of tracking progress systems specifically chosen to
                  measure and maximize performance across all areas of the
                  ecosystem. By monitoring key protocol operations and outcomes,
                  we will gain new perspectives of the ecosystem, including our
                  strengths and vulnerabilities, our evolution over time, and
                  the ways in which we can drive the network forward.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Success criteria that we will base the project on will be
                  predominantly focused on the number of network participants,
                  which includes businesses that require the services offered,
                  token holders we add and retain to the ecosystem, and also the
                  monthly recurring revenue metrics we track determine what is
                  working and what needs to be changed to enhance the
                  decentralized economy's profitability.

                  <br />
                  Four(4) important performance metrics will help guide our
                  decision on projects. They include:
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>MRR:</strong> Monthly recurring revenue will be a key
                  performance metric. It gives us the ability to assess game
                  performance alongside bankroll management and determine ways
                  to increase this whilst limiting a drop in recurring revenue
                  streams and simultaneously researching and developing new
                  ones.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>Network churn Rate:</strong> The churn rate of our
                  network participants is another important key metric that we
                  will be monitoring, as this gives us the ability to take
                  action and limit the rate at which we might be losing
                  community members. Ways to mitigate the churn rate will be
                  implemented as we collect data as the network grows.
                  Communication with network participants will always be at the
                  forefront of keeping our network's satisfaction levels high.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>Network Lifetime Value:</strong> The purpose of the
                  network lifetime value metric is to assess the financial value
                  of each member of the community. We will deploy tactics such
                  as better content to accompany the user journey and specific
                  and personalized content that is relevant to our clients. With
                  the use of machine learning and data analytics, we will
                  intelligently harness data to orchestrate relevant and
                  individualized marketing content to create a positive user and
                  client journey that is not only profitable but is also an
                  educational journey on how to improve their user experience.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>Network Participant Acquisition Cost:</strong> The
                  cost of acquiring network participants is a key metric for our
                  DAO's model, and a dedicated team that focuses on A/B testing
                  to enhance conversion rates will be implemented as soon as we
                  launch the protocol and begin aggressive marketing campaigns.

                  Blockchain technology has varying applications that cut across
                  different industries. However, the gaming aspect of blockchain
                  technology has taken off in recent years. The idea of playing
                  to earn is changing the function of games at its core.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Now, there is a growing notion that gamers should not only
                  have fun doing what they love, but they can also extract
                  monetary value from this endeavor. P2E brings many merits to
                  the table and opens up new revenue streams for casual and
                  professional gamers alike. Considering the global rise of
                  unemployment, this is a welcome development.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Royale Finance is interested in empowering the advancement of
                  blockchain games and play-to-earn, expanding the reach of
                  these applications and bringing these benefits to the masses.
                  To accomplish this, Royale looks to leverage its liquidity
                  provision mechanisms and deploy its decentralized IGO
                  launchpad.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  These two initiatives will take a community-focused approach
                  allowing Royale users to participate in the on-boarding of
                  promising blockchain gaming projects. Our goal on the Play-To
                  Earn side will be to drive liquidity via continuous
                  integrations with high-level efficiency.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  With this, our liquidity providers feel safe, secure, and
                  protected from notorious DeFi bogeymen like liquidation and
                  impermanent loss. The monolithic Royale IGO Launchpad and
                  liquidity pool serve as a staging area for interesting
                  blockchain gaming projects.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Royale Finance's foray into the gaming/blockchain gaming space
                  hinges on the tremendous potential for growth in this niche.

                      figures around $159.3 billion. With the integration of
                      blockchain mechanics and the opportunity for players to

                      The explosive growth of NFT games and player-owned
                      economies. NFT games give players provable ownership over
                      in-game items. With the success of breeding games like
                      CryptoKitties, many other blockchain gaming platforms have
                      arisen operating on similar mechanics.

                      investors.
